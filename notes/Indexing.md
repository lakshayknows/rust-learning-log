Arrays -> Using []
Tuple -> Using .

Arrays:
- Fixed size and element type known at compile time
- Elements can be runtime values
- Homogeneous (same type)
- Variable indexing allowed
- Naturally iterable (loops, indexing, slices)

Tuples:
- Fixed size and structure known at compile time
- Elements can be runtime values
- Heterogeneous (different types)
- Variable indexing not allowed
- Access via compile-time destructuring (pattern matching)
