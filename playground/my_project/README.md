# My Project (Backyard)

This is a short code just to understand modules and crates in Rust.

## Purpose
The project demonstrates how to organize Rust code into modules and use crates effectively. It serves as a practical example for the "Backyard" analogy often used in Rust documentation to explain module visibility and structure.

## Structure
- `src/main.rs`: The entry point.
- `src/library/`: (If applicable) Submodules demonstrating code organization.
