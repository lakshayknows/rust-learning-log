//! rust-learning-log
//!
//! A personal learning log for studying Rust deeply and deliberately.
//!
//! This repository exists to document understanding — not speed,
//! not streaks, and not performance.
//!
//! The approach is simple:
//! - Read the Rust Book
//! - Solve Rustlings exercises independently
//! - Write notes that explain *why* things work, not just *what* works
//!
//! This repo is not a tutorial.
//! It is a record of thinking.

/// ## Structure
///
/// ```text
/// rust-learning-log/
/// ├── rustlings/      // Solved Rustlings exercises (practice)
/// ├── notes/          // Conceptual notes written in my own words
/// ├── playground/     // Experiments, scratch code, and small snippets
/// ├── reflections/    // Periodic learning reflections
/// └── README.md
/// ```
///
/// Each directory serves a distinct purpose:
/// - `rustlings/` proves repetition and hands-on work
/// - `notes/` captures mental models and insights
/// - `playground/` allows exploration without pressure
/// - `reflections/` tracks how my understanding evolves over time

/// ## Notes Philosophy
///
/// Notes are:
/// - concise
/// - opinionated
/// - written for future-me
///
/// They avoid copying documentation verbatim.
/// If something is written here, it is because it clarified my thinking.

/// ## What This Repo Is Not
///
/// - A polished showcase
/// - A replacement for official documentation
/// - A race against chapters or trends
///
/// Rust rewards patience and precision.
/// This repository reflects that.

/// ## Status
///
/// Actively learning.
/// Progress is incremental by design.
///
/// ```
/// slow is smooth
/// smooth is inevitable
/// ```

fn main() {
    // There is nothing to run here.
    // Understanding is the output.
